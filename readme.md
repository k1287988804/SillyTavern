Brought to you by Cohee, RossAscends, and the SillyTavern community, SillyTavern is a local-install interface that allows you to interact with text generation AIs (LLMs) to chat and roleplay with custom characters.

SillyTavern originated as a modification of TavernAI 1.2.8 in February 2023, and has since added many cutting edge features not present in the original TavernAI.

### Features

* Mobile-friendly interface
